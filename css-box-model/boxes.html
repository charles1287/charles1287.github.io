    <h1>Headings Are Block Elements</h1>

    <p>
      Paragraphs are blocks, too. <em>However</em>, &lt;em&gt; and
      &lt;strong&gt; elements are not. They are
      <strong>inline</strong> elements.
    </p>
    <div style="padding-top: 1px"></div>
    <!-- Add this, to prevent margin collapse-->
    <!-- Important part here is that only consecutive elements can collapse into each other. Putting an element with non-zero
    height (hence the padding-top) between our paragraphs forces them to display both the 25px top margin and the 50px
    bottom margin. -->
    <p>
      Block elements define the flow of the HTML document, while inline elements
      do not.
