        Appreciating the Art of others solely because of how bad I am at it.

          Anything well engineered [i.e. Beautiful architecture (so we don't
          have to live in caves), high-performing vehicles (so we aren't
          relegated solely to walking or can travel thousands of miles in the
          span of hours, maybe even colonize other planets ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ ) ]
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>The thought of a better tomorrow.</li>
      <li>
        Learning the intricacies of AI in the hopes of totally automating any
